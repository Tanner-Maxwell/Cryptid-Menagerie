# Testing the Optimization

## Current Status
We've implemented the generic action system alongside the existing code. The attack action has been modified to use the new system.

## Test Steps

### 1. Test Attack Action
1. Start a battle
2. Select a card with an attack action
3. Click on an enemy cryptid
4. Verify:
   - The attack animation plays
   - Damage is applied correctly
   - The card action completes and moves to the next action
   - No errors appear in the console

### 2. What's Changed
- `attack_action_selected()` now calls `card_action_selected("attack", current_card)`
- The input handler checks `active_action.type` first before falling back to old booleans
- All the attack logic is now handled by the generic `handle_card_action()` function

### 3. Debug Output
The system will print:
- "Handling action: attack" when you click
- Any errors will appear in the console

### 4. If Attack Works
Once attack is verified, we can migrate the other actions:
- heal (simple, similar to attack)
- stun/poison (similar patterns)
- push/pull (more complex due to movement)
- move (most complex)

### 5. Rollback Plan
If something doesn't work:
1. The backup is at `tile_map_controller_backup.gd`
2. Just remove the "return" statement in `attack_action_selected()` to use old code
3. Remove the new generic system check in the input handler

## Next Actions After Testing
1. If attack works → Migrate heal action next
2. If issues → Debug and fix before proceeding
3. After all actions work → Remove old code to reduce file size
